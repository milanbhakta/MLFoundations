Collaborating with my partner during the presentation and review process allowed me to gain insights into different problem-solving approaches. Discussing the examples and solutions strengthened my comprehension and honed my ability to articulate solutions effectively. Moving forward, I aim to apply these collaborative learning experiences to tackle more complex problems and improve my programming skills."
